This game was made mostly on Macintosh computers.  We found that there may be some issues when playing the game on a windows computer.  For example in the builder, the bottom of the screen may be cut off.  also, in elimination mode the borders of eliminated tiles to not look as intended.

The levels are loaded from disk in alphabetical order.  for this reason, if you create a level and want it to be the last level, increment the current last levels name, for example: “puzzleLevel13.txt”

There is a rare occurrence where one of the test cases fails.  We believe this is a Swing issue. Running the test cases again should be successful.
